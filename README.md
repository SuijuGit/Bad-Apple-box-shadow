# Bad-Apple-box-shadow
code of the Bad Apple!! movie / with box-shadow(CSS) only

# How to make
1. Convert the original movie into images per 5 frames.
2. Use "Quantize.py".
3. Use "box-shadow.scss" and then compile it (probably you've got to divide up many times to compile it).
4. Finished. (...I regret to say that you may not able to watch the whole HTML/CSS without a high-spec PC)
